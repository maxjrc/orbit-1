# Orbit Remote Admin Setup Guide

## Overview

The Orbit Remote Admin feature allows you to monitor and manage multiple Roblox game servers from a centralized dashboard. This guide will walk you through setting up the enhanced Roblox script and configuring your servers.

## Prerequisites

- Orbit workspace with admin permissions
- Roblox Studio access
- HTTP requests enabled in your Roblox game
- Valid Orbit workspace URL and API key

## Step 1: Install the Remote Admin Script

1. **Download the Script**: Use `Orbitb5-remote-admin.rbxmx` (enhanced version)
2. **Import to Studio**:
   - Open Roblox Studio
   - Go to Model tab > Import
   - Select the `.rbxmx` file
   - Place it in ServerScriptService

## Step 2: Configure the Script

Edit the `Configuration` table in the script:

```lua
local Configuration = {
    -- Required: Replace with your Orbit workspace URL
    url = "https://your-orbit-instance.com",

    -- Required: Replace with your workspace API key
    auth = "orbit_your_api_key_here",

    -- Optional: Customize tracking settings
    bansEnabled = false,
    rankChecking = false,
    groupId = 3167534, -- Your Roblox group ID
    minTrackedRank = 99,
    minutesTillAFK = 2,

    -- Remote Admin Features
    enableRemoteAdmin = true,
    enableChatTracking = true,
    enableEventTracking = true,
    metricsInterval = 30, -- Server metrics update frequency
}
```

## Step 3: Get Your API Key

1. **Access Remote Admin**: Go to `/workspace/[id]/remote-admin` in your Orbit dashboard
2. **Add New Server**: Click "Add Server" button
3. **Fill Server Details**:
   - Name: Your game name
   - Description: Optional description
   - Game ID: Your Roblox place ID
   - Universe ID: Your game's universe ID
   - Max Players: Server capacity
4. **Copy API Key**: After creation, copy the generated API key

## Step 4: Enable HTTP Requests

In Roblox Studio:
1. Go to Home tab > Game Settings
2. Navigate to Security tab
3. Enable "Allow HTTP Requests"
4. Save and publish your game

## Step 5: Test the Integration

1. **Publish Your Game**: Make sure the script is published with your game
2. **Join Your Game**: Play the game to generate test data
3. **Check Remote Admin**: Visit the Remote Admin dashboard to see:

    level = 5,
    score = 1250,
    time = 300
})

-- Track purchases
_G.OrbitRemoteAdmin.TrackPurchase(player, 123456, 100)

_G.OrbitRemoteAdmin.TrackAchievement(player, "First Victory", "Won your first match")
```

### Configuration Options

- `enableChatTracking`: Track chat messages
- `enableEventTracking`: Track game events
- `metricsInterval`: How often to send server performance data

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Appearing
- Check API key is correct
- Verify HTTP requests are enabled
- Check script is in ServerScriptService
- Ensure URL is correct (no trailing slash)

### Chat Not Tracking
- Verify `enableChatTracking = true`
- Check players are actually typing chat
- Ensure players meet rank requirements (if rank checking enabled)

### Authentication Errors
- Verify you have admin permissions in the workspace
- Check API key format starts with "orbit_"
- Ensure workspace ID matches the API key

### No Activity Data
